    "In this notebook, I will provide a detailed analysis of a randomized controlled experiment and evaluate its impact. Additionally, I will explore meta-learners, with a primary focus on the T-Learner model.The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be used to improve causal inference in economics, particularly in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for causal impact evaluation. However, they are primarily limited to estimating average treatment effects (ATE). In cases where scaling up a program involves substantial costs, it is often more valuable to estimate conditional treatment effects (CTE) and conditional average treatment effect (CATE), which help identify the subpopulations that benefit the most from the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enables a two-part analysis. First, I will assess the effectiveness of the program using the randomized controlled experiment. Then, leveraging the rich set of descriptive features available, I will build a predictive model. Then, I will develop a T-learners to perform causal predictive analytics, allowing for a more granular understanding of the treatment effect across different subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the results from the RCT and T-Learners, I will apply these insights to a new dataset to evaluate how the program can be effectively scaled up."

    "#### Overall Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    " Both models explain a very large proportion of variance in expenditure, with very high F-statistics, suggesting the models are statistically significant. However, the treated group has a higher Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9,082.49 compared to the control group's 4,839.51. This indicates that there is more variability in the expenditure outcomes for the treated group compared to the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable-Level Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender (is_male)\n",
    "In the treated group, the coefficient for gender is 183.95 with a p-value of 0.312, which is not statistically significant. Similarly, in the control group, the coefficient for gender is -16.97 with a p-value of 0.727, also not significant. This suggests that gender does not significantly influence expenditure in either group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Ownership (ownes_house)\n",
    "In the treated group, the coefficient for homeownership is 249.37 with a p-value of 0.206, which is not significant. In the control group, the coefficient for homeownership is 36.10 with a p-value of 0.494, also not significant. Thus, owning a house does not significantly affect expenditure in either group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employment Status\n",
    "In both the treated and control groups, employment status has a highly significant negative impact on expenditure. The coefficients for employment status are -5,313.96 (p < 0.001) in the treated group and -5,212.03 (p < 0.001) in the control group, indicating that unemployment significantly reduces expenditure in both groups. The magnitude of the coefficient is almost identical for both groups, suggesting that unemployment remains a crucial factor regardless of treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employment Income\n",
    "In both groups, employment income has a significant positive effect on expenditure. The coefficient for employment income in the treated group is 0.799 (p < 0.001), and in the control group, it is 0.699 (p < 0.001). This means that for every additional dollar of employment income, expenditure increases by approximately 70-80 cents. The effect of employment income is slightly stronger for the treated group, indicating that treatment may amplify the effect of income on expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Employment Income\n",
    "In both the treated and control groups, non-employment income also has a significant positive impact on expenditure. The coefficients for non-employment income are 0.448 (p < 0.001) in the treated group and 0.446 (p < 0.001) in the control group, which suggests that non-employment income consistently increases expenditure in both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age\n",
    "The coefficient for age in both the treated and control groups is not statistically significant. In the treated group, the coefficient is 6.08 (p = 0.662), and in the control group, it is 0.93 (p = 0.794). This suggests that age does not have a significant effect on expenditure in either group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race\n",
    "Race does not significantly influence expenditure in either group, except for a marginally significant result for race[White] in the control group, where the coefficient is 166.09 (p = 0.049). In the treated group, no racial category shows a significant difference in expenditure. Therefore, race has minimal to no impact on expenditure in both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Income (especially employment income)** is the most important predictor of spending in both groups.\n",
    "2. **Unemployment** significantly reduces expenditure in both groups, indicating that employment support is critical for increasing expenditure.\n",
    "3. The effect of treatment appears to increase income sensitivity, especially for employment income, meaning that treated individuals tend to respond more strongly to income changes.\n",
    "4. The treated individuals have more variability in spending (higher RMSE), which may be due to the different ways they respond to the intervention.\n",
    "5. **Demographics like gender, age, and race** do not significantly explain expenditure differences within either group, post-treatment or in control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Targeting individuals based on **employment status and income** is likely the most effective strategy for increasing expenditure.\n",
    "2. A **randomized treatment across demographic groups** appears equitable, as there is no strong evidence of a demographic bias in how the treatment influences expenditure.\n",
    "3. The treatment program has the potential to increase spending, but not equally for everyone—income and employment status are the most critical factors.\n",
    "4. To refine targeting strategies, further analysis should consider **interaction terms**, such as treatment × employment status, to capture more nuanced effects."

    "##### Predicting Expenditure with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have gained valuable insights into how each variable impacts the coefficients in our regression models, we can take the analysis a step further. To enhance our understanding, we will now use Scikit-Learn to fit a linear regression model and evaluate its predictive capabilities. By leveraging Scikit-Learn, we can assess the model's performance using various metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others. This will allow us to better understand how well the model generalizes to new data, which is crucial for making data-driven decisions in policy interventions.\n",

This enables us to estimate the individual treatment effect for each person in the dataset. While these estimates are hypothetical, they provide valuable insight into the potential outcomes of individuals with or without treatment.

    "### Comparing the two sets of results, we can see a clear difference in expenditure patterns between the **random assignment method** and the **T-learner targeting approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Treatment Group (Assigned Treatment)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Assignment: Mean expenditure = $68,943.99, Total expenditure = $13.81 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T-Learner Targeting: Mean expenditure = $119,106.89, Total expenditure = $23.8 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Comparison: The T-learner approach results in a higher mean expenditure (+$50,162.90) and an increase of $9.99 billion in total expenditure, suggesting that targeting individuals most likely to benefit significantly increases the program's economic impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Group (No Treatment)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Assignment: Mean expenditure = $37,351.42, Total expenditure = $29.87 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T-Learner Targeting: Mean expenditure = $32,528.47, Total expenditure = $26.02 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison: The mean expenditure in the control group is slightly lower (-$4,822.95) when using the T-learner method, and total expenditure decreases by about $3.85 billion. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the gains in the treatment group are much much more larger than the losses in the control group. While the average expenditure in the control group is lower by around $5000, the average expenditure in the treatment group is higher by around $50,000 (almost 10 times). This suggests that the T-learner method is more effective in targeting individuals who are likely to benefit from the treatment, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Economic Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Assignment: Mean expenditure = $43,678.08, Total expenditure = $43.69 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T-Learner Targeting: Mean expenditure = $47,822.22, Total expenditure = $47.82 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison: The T-learner method results in an increase of $4,144.14 in mean expenditure and a higher total expenditure by $4.13 billion, indicating a more efficient allocation of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is worth noting that while the T-learner approach significantly increases expenditure within the treatment group, the overall impact on the entire economy is comparatively smaller. This is primarily because only 20% of the population is treated, meaning the control group carries more weight in the overall expenditure calculation, thus lowering the mean expenditure. Nevertheless, it is still evident how the T-learner method improves both mean expenditures and total expenditures by targeting those who are most likely to benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to scale the program to a larger population, the impact could become much more substantial, as the proportion of treated individuals would increase, leading to a larger increase in total expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this also brings up an important policy consideration: fairness vs. equity. Randomized assignment is often viewed as a fair approach because everyone has an equal chance of receiving the treatment, regardless of their characteristics. On the other hand, the T-learner method focuses on those most likely to benefit, making it a more equitable strategy, as resources are allocated where they can generate the greatest impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between these approaches depends on the policy goal: maximizing overall impact (T-learner) or ensuring equal access (random assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-learner approach outperforms random assignment by targeting individuals who are expected to benefit the most from treatment. This leads to a higher mean expenditure per treated individual and a greater overall economic impact. By prioritizing those with the highest predicted treatment effect, the program can maximize its effectiveness while using the same budget constraints."
